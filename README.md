# pump_monitoring
Simulate the monitoring of pressure and flow rate generate by a pump as well as the level of a tank filled up by the pump. A ESP32 node sends data to AWS IoT via MQTT and another ESP32 (Heltec) display values on an OLED display and sends data to a LAMP server running on Raspberry Pi.
Data is also read via an App running on Flutter Android
